Question	Answer	Source
What geological observations will Curiosity engage in, and how will that help in learning about possible life on Mars?	The Mars Science Laboratory rover, Curiosity, will assess whether Mars ever had an environment capable of supporting microbial life - habitability. Whether life has existed on Mars is an open question that this mission, by itself, is not designed to answer. Curiosity does not carry experiments to detect active processes that would signify present-day biological metabolism. Nor does it have the ability to image microorganisms or their fossil equivalents. However, if this mission finds that the field site in Gale Crater has had conditions favourable for habitability and for preserving evidence about life, those findings can shape future missions that would bring samples back to Earth for life-detection tests or for missions that carry advanced life-detection experiments to Mars. In this sense, the Mars Science Laboratory is the prospecting stage in a step-by-step program of exploration, reconnaissance, prospecting and mining evidence for a definitive answer about whether life has existed on Mars.\n\nMars Science Laboratory is part of a series of expeditions to the Red Planet that help meet the four main science goals of the Mars Exploration Program:\n\n* Determine whether life ever arose on Mars\n* Characterize the climate of Mars\n* Characterize the geology of Mars\n* Prepare for human exploration\n\nTo contribute to the four science goals and meet its specific goal of determining Mars' habitability, Mars Science Laboratory has the following science objectives.\n\nBiological:\n\n1. Determine the nature and inventory of organic carbon compounds 2. Inventory the chemical building blocks of life (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, and sulfur) 3. Identify features that may represent the effects of biological processes\n\nGeological and Geochemical:\n\n4. Investigate the chemical, isotopic, and mineralogical composition of the Martian surface and near-surface geological materials 5. Interpret the processes that have formed and modified rocks and soils\n\nPlanetary Process:\n\n6. Assess long-timescale (i.e., 4-billion-year) atmospheric evolution processes 7. Determine present state, distribution, and cycling of water and carbon dioxide\n\nSurface Radiation:\n\n8. Characterize the broad spectrum of surface radiation, including galactic cosmic radiation, solar proton events, and secondary neutrons\n	https://www.nasa.gov/offices/marsplanning/faqs/
Does the soil on Mars contain the ingredients needed to grow plants? Will we need to bring things to enhance the soil?	It would be possible to grow plants on Mars only in technologically advanced, controlled environments that could keep the plants warm and give the plants enough atmosphere, light, and water to live. Scientists anticipate that humans would be able to use the Martian soil as a substrate for plant growth. Based upon results from the Phoenix Mars Lander mission, the soil pH and salt content are not detrimental to plants (scientists working on the mission found that the soil at the Phoenix landing site is very basic, with a pH of between eight and nine).\n\nHuman visitors would likely have to add a little fertilizer, but scientists still do not know enough about the chemistry of the Martian soil to determine what additional fertilizers plants may need. Studies of Martian soil characteristics will help future scientists develop ways to grow plants for human communities on Mars.	https://www.nasa.gov/offices/marsplanning/faqs/
Will any of Curiosity's landing events be recorded on video and sent back to Earth?	\n\nDuring the final few minutes of Curiosity's flight to the surface of Mars, the Mars Descent Imager, or MARDI, will record a full-color video of the ground below. This will provide the Mars Science Laboratory team with information about the landing site and its surroundings, to aid interpretation of the rover's ground-level views and planning of initial drives. Hundreds of the images taken by the camera will show features smaller than what can be discerned in images taken from orbit. The video will also give fans worldwide an unprecedented sense of what it might feel like to ride a spacecraft to a landing on Mars.\n\nMARDI will record the video on its own 8 gigabyte flash memory, at about four frames per second and close to 1,600 by 1,200 pixels per frame. Thumbnails and a few samples of full-resolution frames will be transmitted to Earth in the first days after landing. The nested set of images from higher altitude to ground level will enable pinpointing of Curiosity's location. The pace of sending the rest of the frames for full-resolution video will depend on sharing priority with data from the rover's other investigations.\n\nThe full video - available first from the thumbnails in YouTube-like resolution and later in full detail - will begin with a glimpse of the heat shield falling away from beneath the rover. The first views of the ground will cover an area several kilometers (a few miles) across. Successive frames taken as the vehicle descends will close in and cover successively smaller areas. The video will likely nod up and down to fairly large angles owing to parachute-induced oscillations. Its roll clockwise and counterclockwise will be smaller, as thrusters on the descent stage control that motion. When the parachute is jettisoned, the video will show large angular motions as the descent vehicle maneuvers to avoid re-contacting the back shell and parachute. Rocket engine vibration may also be seen. A few seconds before landing, the rover will be lowered on tethers beneath the descent stage, and the video will show the relatively slow approach to the surface. The final frames, after landing, will cover a bath-towel-size patch of ground under the front-left corner of the rover.\n\nIn addition to meeting the main objective of providing geologic context for the observations and operations of the rover during the early part of mission on Mars, MARDI will also provide insight about Mars' atmosphere. Combining information from the descent images with information from the spacecraft's motion sensors will enable calculation of wind speeds affecting the spacecraft on its way down, an important atmospheric science measurement. The descent data will affect design and testing of future landing systems for Mars that could add more control for hazard avoidance.\n\nThroughout Curiosity's mission on Mars, MARDI will offer the capability to obtain images of ground beneath the rover at resolutions down to 0.06 inch (1.5 millimeters) per pixel, for precise tracking of its movements or for geologic mapping - the science team will decide whether or not to use that capability. Each day of operations on Mars will require choices about how to budget power, data and time.\n	https://www.nasa.gov/offices/marsplanning/faqs/
Is there a microphone on Curiosity so that the sound of wind and sounds the rover makes itself can be heard by us back on Earth?	Although sound could be recorded on Mars, Curiosity does not carry a recording device. There are three NASA sites that might help you explore the relevant concepts further:	https://www.nasa.gov/offices/marsplanning/faqs/
What is the amount of oxygen in Mars' atmosphere?	The oxygen content of the Martian atmosphere is only 0.13 percent, compared with 21 percent in Earth's atmosphere. Carbon dioxide makes up 95.3 percent of the gas in the atmosphere of Mars. It also contains nitrogen and argon and very small amounts of water and methane.	https://www.nasa.gov/offices/marsplanning/faqs/
How deep will Curiosity be able to dig to find water and/or indications of life?	Although the Mars Science Laboratory rover, Curiosity, does not have a tool specifically for digging, as on the earlier rovers, the mobility system can be used to dig beneath the surface by rotating one corner wheel while keeping the other five wheels immobile. However, whether life has existed on Mars is an open question that this mission, by itself, is not designed to answer. Curiosity does not carry experiments to detect active processes that would signify present-day biological metabolism, nor does it have the ability to image microorganisms or their fossil equivalents.\n\nHowever, if this mission finds that the field site in Gale Crater has had conditions favorable for habitability and for preserving evidence about life, those findings can shape future missions that would bring samples back to Earth for life-detection tests or for missions that carry advanced life-detection experiments to Mars. In this sense, the Mars Science Laboratory is the prospecting stage in a step-by-step program of exploration, reconnaissance, prospecting and mining evidence for a definitive answer about whether life has existed on Mars. NASA's Astrobiology Program has aided in development of the Mars Science Laboratory science payload and in studies of extreme habitats on Earth that can help in understanding possible habitats on Mars.	https://www.nasa.gov/offices/marsplanning/faqs/
We know that the surface of Mars is red colored, sandy and rocky. But what we do not know is what lies beneath the surface of Mars. Is this something that Curiosity also will investigate, during its mission on Mars, using radio waves or would that be a very different mission?	Curiosity carries the Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons (DAN) instrument, which can detect water bound into shallow underground minerals along Curiosity's path. The DAN instrument shoots neutrons into the ground and measures how they are scattered, giving it a high sensitivity for finding any hydrogen to a depth of about 20 inches (50 centimeters) directly beneath the rover. The instrument can be used to help identify places for examination by Curiosity's other tools. Also, rock formations that Curiosity's cameras view at the surface may be traced underground by DAN, extending scientists' understanding of Mars' geology.\n\nThanks to the SHARAD (Shallow Radar) instrument onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, we do know more about what lies beneath the surface of Mars. SHARAD looks for liquid or frozen water in the first few hundreds of feet (up to 1 kilometer) of Mars' crust. SHARAD probes the subsurface using radar waves within a 15- to 25-megahertz frequency band to get the desired, high-depth resolution. The radar wave return, which is captured by the SHARAD antenna, is sensitive to changes in the electrical reflection characteristics of rock, sand, and any water that may be present in the surface and subsurface. Water, like high-density rock, is highly conducting, and has a very strong radar return.   \n\n\nAdditionally, landed missions such as the Mars Exploration Rovers and the Phoenix Mars Mission have enhanced our understanding of what lies just beneath the surface. The Phoenix Mars Mission did this with its [specially-designed robotic arm with scoop] and the Mars Exploration Rovers did so by locking five of their six wheels and using the free wheel to dig into the sand and soil in an activity the mission team called "trenching" (for example: [Opportunity Digs, Spirit Advances] Curiosity's mobility system can be used in a similar way.\n	https://www.nasa.gov/offices/marsplanning/faqs/
When will we send a mission to the poles of Mars? What are the dangers of such a mission and why?	In the continuing pursuit of water on Mars, the polar regions are a good place to probe, as water ice is found there. NASA has already sent two lander missions to the poles of Mars. The first, [Mars Polar Lander](http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/programmissions/missions/past/polarlander/) (1999) - an ambitious mission to set a spacecraft down on the frigid terrain near the edge of Mars' south polar cap and dig for water ice with a robotic arm - was lost upon arrival. The 2007-2008 Phoenix Mars Mission to the north pole of Mars, on the other hand, was a great success. Phoenix landed farther north than any previous mission, at a latitude equivalent to that of northern Alaska on Earth, and used a robotic arm to dig through the protective top soil layer to the water ice below, bringing both soil and water ice to the lander platform for sophisticated scientific analysis. Read more about the results of this exciting polar mission at the [Phoenix Mars Mission website](http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/index.php).\n\n There are a number of informative videos about the challenges of landing on Mars available in the [Mars Exploration Program video archive](http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/videoarchive/). You can read specifically about the landing of the Phoenix Mars Mission at [Phoenix Mars Mission: Entry, Descent and Landing](http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/phases04.php)\n	https://www.nasa.gov/offices/marsplanning/faqs/
I am a middle school science teacher just starting to use Project-Based Learning and want to create a unit that included the study of Mars and our solar system. What would be a deep, open-ended driving question for such a unit?	\n\nIt sounds like your class might be a great match for [NASA's Mars Student Imaging Project (MSIP)](http://msip.asu.edu/), because the heart of MSIP is students coming up with their own research questions about Mars. MSIP is a NASA opportunity, for anyone from grade 5 through college, to participate in NASA research opportunities free of charge. This program offers teams or classes of students the opportunity to work (either in person or via distance-learning technologies) with scientists, mission planners and educators on the team (at Arizona State University's Mars Space Flight Facility) that manages the THEMIS visible wavelength camera onboard the Mars Odyssey spacecraft currently orbiting Mars.\n\nIn MSIP, participants engage in a curricular unit that scaffolds their creation of an observation plan, from determining the question to analyzing the data. With the help of spacecraft controllers, the students send the commands to the spacecraft in orbit around Mars. When the spacecraft has completed the requested observations, it sends the image back to Earth to be processed and analyzed by participating students. This project is not intended to add to the regular science curriculum. Instead, as a National Science Education Standards-aligned series of activities, it can be used to teach standards-based material in a new and exciting way. And because students are working with real data, real discoveries are possible. In fact, a middle school team in California [discovered a cave skylight on Mars]	https://www.nasa.gov/offices/marsplanning/faqs/
What is the thickness of the atmosphere of Mars?	\n\nThe atmosphere of Mars is thin, cold, and dry and contains much less oxygen than the atmosphere of Earth. The oxygen content of the Martian atmosphere is only 0.13 percent, compared with 21 percent in Earth's atmosphere. Carbon dioxide makes up 95.3 percent of the gas in the atmosphere of Mars. It also contains nitrogen and argon and very small amounts of water and methane. Additionally, the atmospheric pressure on Mars is only about 1/100 that of Earth's!\n\nScientists are studying why Mars' atmosphere is so thin. It may be because there's not as much sunlight arriving at Mars as there is on Earth, since Mars is 1 1/2 times farther away from the sun than the Earth is. It may be that Mars had a lot of atmosphere in the early part of the planet's history, but once its magnetic field disappeared, this lack of a protective barrier allowed sunlight to strip away the upper atmosphere, making the atmosphere thinner. (The upper atmosphere of a planet is constantly bombarded by the solar wind, a fast stream of very light particles emanating from the sun. This wind itself is fairly benign, but it also carries a magnetic field. This field picks up ions from the upper atmosphere, accelerates them, and then smashes them back into other ions at several hundred kilometers per second, knocking ions out to space. If the planet itself has a magnetic field, it can shield the upper atmosphere from the solar wind. However, because it is a small planet, Mars cooled rapidly so that its inner dynamo disappeared and it lost its original magnetic field quickly.)\n	https://www.nasa.gov/offices/marsplanning/faqs/
Has there been thought of creating a calendar for Mars?	Many people have considered how humans might keep time on Mars.

I wonder if the Mars Curiosity mission will transmit real-time data to the Internet so the public can have access to it. It would really spark a lot of interest.	\n\nAs with other Mars missions, you can access data from Curiosity. Visit [http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl](http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl). Additionally, a new way of following the day-to-day discoveries on Mars is available through an online virtual experience called [Curiosity's Journey](http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/explore/curiosity/).\n\nLearn more about the way communications are handled between Earth and Mars at [MSL: Communication With Earth](http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/communicationwithearth/). For a more detailed look at how this will work during Curiosity's surface operations, see the Mars Science Laboratory Landing Press Kit available for download at the [MSL Newsroom](http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/news/newsroom/)\n	https://www.nasa.gov/offices/marsplanning/faqs/
Will Curiosity explore microbial life on Mars? Is there any evidence that once there had been life on Mars?	\n\nWhether life has existed on Mars is an open question that this mission, by itself, is not designed to answer. Curiosity does not carry experiments to detect active processes that would signify present-day biological metabolism, nor does it have the ability to image microorganisms or their fossil equivalents.

NASA's Astrobiology Program has aided in development of the Mars Science Laboratory science payload and in studies of extreme habitats on Earth that can help in understanding possible habitats on Mars.\n\n\n### Human Spaceflight\n\n	https://www.nasa.gov/offices/marsplanning/faqs/
Who will get to go to Mars?	You could go to Mars! Astronauts have a variety of science, technology, engineering and mathematics backgrounds, and an even broader group of people on Earth will support Mars exploration missions! NASA will need people to help us learn how to prepare for the journey, grow food during the trip, handle recycling needs and build systems to take us to Mars and support systems here on Earth. We also will need experts in software development and communications systems.	https://www.nasa.gov/offices/marsplanning/faqs/
What possible landing sites are being considered for human habitation?	There are many possible landing sites of scientific interest. Current robotic missions on Mars are helping NASA scientists learn about the Martian surface and its environment. This information will help us select the actual site. That site will depend on many factors, including terrain, soil and surface properties; areas of science priority; and access to and quality of local resources.	https://www.nasa.gov/offices/marsplanning/faqs/
Does NASA plan to make human missions to Mars a round trip?	Absolutely. We want our crews to return with valuable scientific insights. Also, their unique learning experiences will greatly benefit future missions to the Red Planet.	https://www.nasa.gov/offices/marsplanning/faqs/
When will the first human mission to Mars be?	NASA currently is working to build the systems to take astronauts beyond low Earth orbit. NASA is working to meet the President's goal to send humans to Mars in the 2030s. We are developing the technology we will need and designing safety measures to protect our astronauts from the harsh environment beyond low Earth orbit.	https://www.nasa.gov/offices/marsplanning/faqs/
How long will it take to get to Mars?	It depends on how you go, what kind of rocket is used and what technologies are available. With current technology, our robotic missions usually take about 8 months to travel to Mars. We are exploring options that will minimize the duration of a human trip to Mars.	https://www.nasa.gov/offices/marsplanning/faqs/
How long will a mission to Mars last?	Earth's and Mars' orbit around the sun allow for an opportunity to embark to Mars about every 26 months. There are two scenarios for going to Mars and returning to Earth. The first requires astronauts to remain on Mars for only a few weeks before returning. The second scenario will see astronauts spending over a year on the Red Planet. The overall mission duration ranges from about a year to close to three years.	https://www.nasa.gov/offices/marsplanning/faqs/
What are the dangers to humans on Mars (dust, gravity, radiation, etc.)?	Any mission that takes humans beyond the safety of Earth includes hazards. [Entry through Mars' atmosphere and landing on the planet is a challenge in itself.](http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/videogallery/index.html?media_id=146903741) NASA still is learning about the environment on Mars, including radiation levels and dust. In fact, the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft will take important measurements during the course of entry and descent through the atmosphere, and the Curiosity rover will measure the radiation environment on the surface. Curiosity also carries instruments to measure the characteristics of Martian soil.	https://www.nasa.gov/offices/marsplanning/faqs/
How will a Mars spacesuit differ from those used in low-Earth orbit or on the moon?	Spacesuits used in low Earth orbit are designed for microgravity. The gravity on Mars is about one-third of the gravity on Earth. Spacesuits for Mars also will be designed for walking on the surface and performing science and other activities.	https://www.nasa.gov/offices/marsplanning/faqs/
What kind of spacecraft will be used to get to Mars?	It won't be just one spacecraft. We are going to need to take enough parts that allow us to travel safely over long times and distances. These different parts include a habitat for the crew to live and work in as well as the spacecraft for the crew to launch from Earth and also be able to land when we return.	https://www.nasa.gov/offices/marsplanning/faqs/
Is the moon being considered as a gateway or springboard to Mars?	NASA is busy building the next generation of spacecraft that will take humans further into the solar system than ever before. Although the lessons learned from our trips to the moon will greatly enhance our understanding of exploring planets other than our own, our current focus is to travel to a near-Earth asteroid by 2025 and then on to Mars after that.	https://www.nasa.gov/offices/marsplanning/faqs/
Are robotic precursor missions to scout and supply future human missions being considered?	Yes. The robotic missions that NASA has flown to Mars already have provided us with valuable information that will help in planning for the first human mission to Mars.	https://www.nasa.gov/offices/marsplanning/faqs/
Do we have the technology today to get to Mars?	NASA does have the rocket technology to get humans to Mars. However, current technology is not advanced enough to get us there efficiently. We are continuing to develop technologies to improve that efficiency. Another challenge we are actively working to overcome is the heat shield that will be needed to protect the returning capsule as it passes through Earth's atmosphere.	https://www.nasa.gov/offices/marsplanning/faqs/
Is NASA planning to establish a permanent settlement on Mars?	NASA has conducted several studies on the feasibility of establishing a permanent settlement on Mars. At this time, we are not looking to implement such a plan. We will be in a better position to evaluate such a plan after we have perfected the ability to go to Mars and return safely, as well as ensuring that we have the technology to create the necessary resources while on the Red Planet to survive.	https://www.nasa.gov/offices/marsplanning/faqs/
What kind of fuel is NASA considering for a trip to Mars?	NASA is evaluating several different kinds of fuel for trips to Mars. Options include nuclear thermal, nuclear electric, solar electric and various chemical propellants.	https://www.nasa.gov/offices/marsplanning/faqs/
How will NASA send or create the resources necessary for humans on Mars?	\n\nNASA is looking at a variety of options to sustain human exploration on Mars. Although it is possible to carry all the necessary resources with us for a trip to and from Mars, it is not feasible. The weight of all of those resources would preclude an efficient launch. As such, NASA is looking at ways to extract resources such as oxygen and water from the Martian atmosphere and soil. We also are looking at ways to create other necessities like fuel and food from the natural resources found on the Red Planet.\n\n\n### Technology and Partnerships\n\n	https://www.nasa.gov/offices/marsplanning/faqs/
How can we reduce the travel time to Mars?	In-space propulsion is a key technology hurdle to shorten a trip to Mars. NASA's [In-Space Propulsion Systems Roadmap (PDF)](http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/501329main_TA02-ID_rev3-NRC-wTASR.pdf) included a good discussion on this topic.	https://www.nasa.gov/offices/marsplanning/faqs/
Why can't we have a live video feed from Mars?	NASA is working on laser communications technology that will improve data rates in space. Current data transmission capabilities do not allow for live video feed from deep space. Read more about this new technology at the [Deep Space Optical Communications Project website](http://gcd.larc.nasa.gov/projects/deep-space-optical-communications/).	https://www.nasa.gov/offices/marsplanning/faqs/
How can humans survive on Mars? What are the requirements for humans to survive on another planet?	\n\nIntriguing questions. In one way the answer is obvious, but there is much more depth as soon as one gives it some thought. I expect a Ph.D. student could write a whole dissertation on the subject, so I'll just summarize some ideas here. You get to cherry-pick the useful ones and expand on them.\n\nThe obvious answer is that since humans have lived for long periods in Earth orbit, in the ocean depths, and for short periods on the Moon, it seems we can live anywhere that we can supply air, water, and food.\n\nFor long durations, we must add spare parts for life support systems to the other items. So living anywhere requires funding to pay for the materials necessary (at a minimum, air, water, and food) and their transport, as well as the infrastructure to manufacture the systems to transport the necessities to the human outpost.\n\nIf the goal is to limit the necessity for constantly supplying the outpost with the necessities, the question still comes down to how much materiel is sent to the outpost initially vs. how hospitable the planet having the outpost is. Suppose we want an outpost on a giant icy moon of Jupiter's. With sufficient available power (solar, or some other source) and an air-tight habitat, colonists could grow plants hydroponically (provides food and clears the air of carbon dioxide while producing oxygen) and melt the ice for water lost in the recycling process. Some of the water could be broken down to free additional oxygen for breathing and to replace losses. Radiation protection would have to be built into the habitat too. All this could be done.\n\nA more hospitable planet could still be cold enough that the only water is ice (which could be melted) but some atmosphere would be good, at least as thick Earth's atmosphere at the bottom of the "death zone" recognized by Himalayan mountain climbers. People could then survive in an atmosphere that doesn't support life by wearing oxygen masks, but not pressure suits.\n\n(I don't know at what altitude a pressure suit would be required; it is probably higher than the base of the death zone. Note that the atmosphere cannot be poisonous; that's different from not supporting life. Chlorine gas is poisonous and will hurt organs and kill people. Nitrogen, the largest fractional component of Earth's atmosphere, won't support life but doesn't damage us.)\n\nJust how warm a planet would be live-able is not obvious to me. Venus is too hot, but a planet that had Death Valley temperatures everywhere might still be live-able, if there is accessible water.\n\nAstronomers looking for exoplanets want to find Earth-like planets in the habitable zone, where temperatures permit liquid water to be present on the exoplanets' surfaces. This is a reasonable shorthand way of describing the requirements for a habitable planet, but it doesn't take into account that both nature and humans can create small habitats suitable for life in what would otherwise be considered very extreme conditions.\n\nI hope this discussion helps you narrow down your question, or inspires you to consider more of the possibilities.\n\nStephen Edberg NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology\n	https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/faq
When will people go to Mars?	\n\nCurrently there are not any planned human missions to Mars, but there are several concept missions that will help pave the way for humans to visit Mars in the future.	https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/faq
Why is Mars heavily cratered?	Mars does not have a sufficient (big enough) atmosphere to protect it from impacts by such objects as meteorites, asteroids and comets. Also, Mars is not as active a planet as the Earth is, for example, so there isn't enough activity (such as volcanic, water erosion, or other forms of resurfacing) to cover over craters.	https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/faq
How much would I weigh on Mars?	Since Mars has less gravity than Earth, you would weigh 62% less than you do here on Earth.	https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/faq
How far is Mars from the Earth?	Mars and the Earth are at their closest point to each other about every two years, with a distance of about 56 million km (34.8 million miles) between them at that time. The farthest that the Earth and Mars can be apart is: 401 million km (249 million miles). This is due to the fact that both Mars and the Earth have elliptical orbits and Mars' orbit is tilted in comparison with the Earth's. They also orbit the sun at different rates.	https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/faq
Is Mars really red?	Yes, this is due to iron in the soil. This iron rusts and causes the surface and the sky (from kicked up dust) to take on a reddish color. This is why Mars is called the Red Planet.	https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/faq
Are there aliens or Martians on Mars?	No, at least none have been found. So far we have not found any evidence of life (in any form) on Mars.	https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/faq
Is there water on Mars?	Yes, but the Martian atmosphere is too thin for liquid water to exist for long on the surface. Water on Mars is found in the form of water-ice just under the surface in the polar regions and in hypothesized briny (salty) water, which seasonally flows in other areas on Mars.	https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/faq
How hot does it get on Mars? How cold?	The temperature on Mars can be as high as 70 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) or as low as about -225 degrees Fahrenheit (-153 degrees Celsius).	https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/faq
How long is a year on Mars?	It takes Mars nearly two (1.9) Earth years to complete one year on Mars.	https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/faq
How long is a day on Mars?	Actually very similar to the length of an Earth day. A day on Mars only takes 24.623 hours.	https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/faq
How many hours is a day on Mars?	Actually very similar to the length of an Earth day. A day on Mars only takes 24.623 hours.	https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/faq
How many earth day in Mars' year?	Actually very similar to the length of an Earth day. A day on Mars only takes 24.623 hours.	https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/faq
How many missions have visited the Red Planet?	Quite a few: [Missions to Mars](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/missions/profile.cfm?Sort=Target&amp;Target=Mars&amp;Era=Present)	https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/faq
How big is Mars?	Mars is about half as big as the Earth: Mars is 6,779 km (4,212.28 miles) across (diameter).	https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/faq
Does Mars have an atmosphere?	Yes, but Mars' atmosphere is thin.	https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/faq
Are there seasons (spring, summer, winter, fall) on Mars?	Mars has seasons similar to those of the Earth, but longer. The seasons on Mars last about twice as long as those on Earth. However, the length of each season is not exactly the same since Mars has a slightly more elliptical orbit around the sun than does Earth. Spring in the northern hemisphere (autumn in the southern) is the longest season at 194 Sols (Martian days). Autumn in the northern hemisphere (spring in the southern) is the shortest at 142 days. Northern winter/southern summer is 154 Sols, and northern summer/southern winter is 178 Sols. That brings a Martian year to 668 Sols (or about 687 Earth days, about twice as long as an Earth year). A year, of course, is the time it takes for a planet to orbit once around the sun.	https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/faq
Does Mars have any moons?	Yes, Mars have two moons. Their names are Phobos and Deimos.	https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/faq
Does Mars have a magnetic field?	Mars does not have a global magnetic field, but NASA's Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) orbiter found that areas of the Martian crust in the southern hemisphere are highly magnetized.	https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/faq
What's the difference between climate change and global warming?	Global temperature rise from 1880 to 2015.

Global temperature shows a well-documented rise since the early 20th century and most notably since the late 1970s. Worldwide, since 1880 the average surface temperature has gone up by about 0.8 °C (1.4 °F), relative to the mid-20th-century baseline (of 1951-1980). \n\n"Climate change" encompasses global warming, but refers to the broader range of changes that are happening to our planet. These include rising sea levels, shrinking mountain glaciers, accelerating ice melt in Greenland, Antarctica and the Arctic, and shifts in flower/plant blooming times. These are all consequences of the warming, which is caused mainly by people burning fossil fuels and putting out heat-trapping gases into the air. The terms "global warming" and "climate change" are sometimes used interchangeably, but strictly they refer to slightly different things.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n*   [NASA finds 2013 sustained long-term climate warming trend](http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/news/20140121/)\n*   [Five-year global temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2013](http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/details.cgi?aid=4135)	https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/
What's the difference between weather and climate?	Credit: Creative Travel Projects/Shutterstock.com Some people say "weather is what you get" and "climate is what you expect." "Weather" refers to the more local changes in the climate we see around us, on short timescales from minutes to hours to days to weeks. Examples are familiar - rain, snow, clouds, winds, thunderstorms, heat waves and floods. "Climate" refers to longer-term averages (they may be regional or global), and can be thought of as the weather averaged over several seasons, years or decades. Climate change is harder for us to get a sense of because the timescales involved are much longer, and the impact of climate changes can be less immediate. Examples of climate change include several drier-than-normal summers, a trend of, say, winters becoming milder from our grandparents' childhood to our own, or variations in effects like El Niño or La Niña.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n*   [Just 5 questions: Weather vs. climate](http://climate.nasa.gov/news/337/)	https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/
Is the sun causing global warming?	\n\nNo. The sun can influence the Earth's climate, but it isn't responsible for the warming trend we've seen over the past few decades. The sun is a giver of life; it helps keep the planet warm enough for us to survive. We know subtle changes in the Earth's orbit around the sun are responsible for the comings and goings of the ice ages. But the warming we've seen over the last few decades is too rapid to be linked to changes in Earth's orbit, and too large to be caused by solar activity. In fact, recently (2005-2010) the sun has become less active, while temperatures have marched upwards.\n\nOne of the "smoking guns" that tells us the sun is not causing global warming comes from looking at the amount of the sun's energy that hits the top of the atmosphere. Since 1978, scientists have been tracking this using sensors on satellites and what they tell us is that there has been no upward trend in the amount of the sun's energy reaching Earth.\n Global surface temperature (top, blue) and the sun's energy received at the top of Earth's atmosphere (red, bottom), from 1978 to 2009. The amount of solar energy received at the top of our atmosphere has followed its natural 11-year cycle of small ups and downs, but with no net increase. Over the same period, global temperature has risen markedly. It is therefore extremely unlikely that the sun has been behind the global temperature trend we've seen over several decades. Credit: NOAA National Climatic Data Center. \n\nA second smoking gun is that if the sun were responsible for global warming, we would expect to see warming throughout all layers of the atmosphere, from the surface all the way up to the upper atmosphere (stratosphere). But what we actually see is warming at the surface and cooling in the stratosphere. This is consistent with the warming being caused by a build-up of heat-trapping gases near the surface of the Earth, and not by the sun getting "hotter."\n\nREAD MORE\n\n*   [Sun & climate: moving in opposite directions](http://www.skepticalscience.com/solar-activity-Sunspots-global-warming-intermediate.htm)	https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/
Is it too late to prevent climate change?	Credit: BrAt82/Shutterstock.com. Humans have caused major climate changes to happen already, and we have set in motion more changes still. Even if we stopped emitting greenhouse gases today, global warming would continue to happen for at least several more decades if not centuries. That's because it takes a while for the planet (for example, the oceans) to respond, and because carbon dioxide - the predominant heat-trapping gas - lingers in the atmosphere for hundreds of years. There is a time lag between what we do and when we feel it.\n\nIn the absence of major action to reduce emissions, global temperature is on track to rise by an average of 6 °C (10.8 °F), according to the latest estimates. Some scientists argue a "global disaster" is already unfolding at the poles of the planet; the Arctic, for example, may be ice-free in the summer within just a few years. Yet other experts are concerned about Earth passing one or more "tipping points" - abrupt, perhaps irreversible changes that tip our climate into a new state.\n Thwaites Glacier. Credit: NASA. But it may not be too late to avoid or limit some of the worst effects of climate change. Responding to climate change will involve a two-tier approach: 1) "mitigation" - reducing the flow of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere; and 2) "adaptation" - learning to live with, and adapt to, the climate change that has already been set in motion. The key question is: what will our emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants be in the years to come? Recycling and driving more fuel-efficient cars are examples of important behavioral change that will help, but they will not be enough. Because climate change is a truly global, complex problem with economic, social, political and moral ramifications, the solution will require both a globally-coordinated response (such as international policies and agreements between countries, a push to cleaner forms of energy) and local efforts on the city- and regional-level (for example, public transport upgrades, energy efficiency improvements, sustainable city planning, etc.). It's up to us what happens next.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n*   [An unrecognizable Arctic](http://climate.nasa.gov/news/958)	https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/
Is the ozone hole causing climate change?	False-color view of total ozone over the Antarctic pole. Purple and blue represent areas where there is the least ozone, yellows and reds where there is more ozone. Credit: NASA Ozone Hole Watch. Yes and no. The ozone hole is basically a man-made hole in the ozone layer above the South Pole during the Southern Hemisphere's spring. The ozone layer, which lies high up in the atmosphere, shields us from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays that come from the sun. Unfortunately we punched a hole in it, through the use of gases like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in spray cans and refrigerants, which break down ozone molecules in the upper atmosphere.\n\nWhile some of the sun's UV rays slip through the hole, they account for less than one percent of the sun's energy. So these UV rays cannot explain the global warming of the planet.\n\nWhat scientists have uncovered recently, however, is that the ozone hole has been affecting climate in the Southern Hemisphere. That's because ozone is also a powerful greenhouse gas, and destroying it has made the stratosphere (the second layer of the atmosphere going upwards) over the Southern Hemisphere colder. The colder stratosphere has resulted in faster winds near the pole, which somewhat surprisingly can have impacts all the way to the equator, affecting tropical circulation and rainfall at lower latitudes. The ozone hole is not causing global warming, but it is affecting atmospheric circulation.\n	https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/
Do scientists agree on climate change?	Credit: nito/Shutterstock.com Yes, the vast majority of actively publishing climate scientists - 97 percent - agree that humans are causing global warming and climate change. Most of the leading science organizations around the world have issued public statements expressing this, including international and U.S. science academies, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and a whole host of reputable scientific bodies around the world). The number of peer-reviewed scientific papers that reject the consensus on human-caused global warming is a vanishingly small proportion of the published research. The small amount of dissent tends to come from a few vocal scientists who are not experts in the climate field or do not understand the scientific basis of long-term climate processes.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n*   [Consensus: 97% of climate scientists agree](http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/)\n*   ["The scientific consensus on climate change,"](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/306/5702/1686.summary) N.

What's NASA got to do with climate change?	NASA has more than a dozen Earth science spacecraft/instruments in orbit studying all aspects of the Earth system (oceans, land, atmosphere, biosphere, cryosphere), with several more planned for launch in the next few years. When people think of NASA, they think of rovers on Mars, astronauts floating aboard the International Space Station, or probes veering out to the edge of the solar system. They don't necessarily link NASA with climate research and observations. But Earth is a planet too, and NASA is one of the biggest players in the Earth science arena, with broad expertise on observing our climate, especially from the vantage point of space. Today it spends over a billion dollars a year doing Earth science and has more than a dozen satellites in orbit around the planet watching the oceans, land, ice, atmosphere and biosphere.\n\nIn the 1970s, NASA's planetary exploration budget fell dramatically. It was then that the agency really got into the business of studying our home planet from orbit. It was also a time when people were beginning to realize that our climate could change relatively fast, on the scale of the human lifespan. Today, we know that our climate is changing at an unprecedented rate and that humans are a key part of that change. NASA continues to launch new satellite missions, and is also relying on aircraft (manned and unmanned), as well as scientists on the ground, to take vital measurements of things like snowpack and hurricanes, augmenting the big-picture view we get from space.\n\nNASA's role is to make observations of our Earth system that can be used by the public, policymakers and to support strategic decisions. Its job is to do rigorous science. However, the agency does not promote particular climate policies.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n*   [NASA's role: Taking a global perspective on Earth's climate](http://climate.nasa.gov/nasa_role/)	https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/
What is the greenhouse effect?	Credit: NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The greenhouse effect is the way in which heat is trapped close to the surface of the Earth by "greenhouse gases". These heat-trapping gases can be thought of as a blanket wrapped around the Earth, which keeps it toastier than it would be without them. Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides.\n\nGreenhouse gases arise naturally, and are part of the make-up of our atmosphere. Earth is sometimes called the "Goldilocks" planet - it's not too hot, not too cold, and the conditions are just right to allow life, including us, to flourish. Part of what makes Earth so amenable is the naturally-arising greenhouse effect, which keeps the planet at a friendly 15 °C (59 °F) on average. But in the last century or so, humans have been interfering with the energy balance of the planet, mainly through the burning of fossil fuels that give off additional carbon dioxide into the air. The level of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere has been rising consistently for decades and traps extra heat near the surface of the Earth, causing temperatures to rise.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n*   [The greenhouse effect](https://www.ucar.edu/learn/1_3_1.htm)	https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/
How do we know what greenhouse gas and temperature levels were in the distant past?	A thin section of an ice core extracted from under the Greenland Ice Sheet. Credit: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center/Ludovic Brucker. Ice cores are scientists' best source for historical climate data. Every winter, some snow coating Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets is left behind and compressed into a layer of ice. By extracting cylinders of ice from sheets thousands of meters thick, scientists can analyze dust, ash, pollen and bubbles of atmospheric gas trapped inside. The deepest discovered ice cores are an estimated 800,000 years old. The particles trapped inside give scientists clues about volcanic eruptions, desert extent and forest fires. The presence of certain ions indicates past ocean activity, levels of sea ice and even the intensity of the sun. The bubbles can be released to reveal the make-up of the ancient atmosphere, including greenhouse gas levels. Credit: roundstripe/Shutterstock.com Other tools for learning about Earth's ancient atmosphere include growth rings in trees, which keep a rough record of each growing season's temperature, moisture and cloudiness going back about 2,000 years. Corals also form growth rings that provide information about temperature and nutrients in the tropical ocean.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n*   [Reconstructing past atmospheres](http://www.iceandclimate.nbi.ku.dk/research/past_atmos/)\n*   [Climate close-up: Coral reefs](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Paleoclimatology_CloseUp/paleoclimatology_closeup_2.php)\n*   [Global temperatures, volcanic eruptions and trees that didn't bark](http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2012/02/global-temperatures-volcanic-eruptions-and-trees-that-didnt-bark/)	https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/
Why does the temperature record shown on your "Vital Signs" page begin at 1880?	Temperature data from four international science institutions. All show rapid warming in the past few decades. According to NASA data, 2013 tied with 2009 and 2006 for the seventh warmest year since 1880, continuing a long-term trend of rising global temperatures. With the exception of 1998, the 10 warmest years in the 134-year record all have occurred since 2000, with 2010 and 2005 ranking as the warmest years on record. Credit: NASA. \n\nThree of the world's most complete temperature tracking records - from NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Climactic Data Center and the UK Meteorological Office's Hadley Centre - begin in 1880. Prior to 1880, temperature measurements were made with instruments like thermometers. The oldest continuous temperature record is the Central England Temperature Data Series, which began in 1659, and the Hadley Centre has some measurements beginning in 1850, but there are too few data before 1880 for scientists to estimate average temperatures for the entire planet. Data from earlier years is reconstructed from proxy records like tree rings, pollen counts and ice cores. Because these are different kinds of data, scientists generally don't put proxy-based estimates on the same charts as the "instrumental record."\n\nThe above-mentioned agencies and others collect temperature data from thousands of weather stations worldwide, including over the ocean, in Antarctica and from satellites. However, instruments are not perfectly distributed around the globe, and some measurement sites have been deforested or urbanized since 1880, affecting temperatures nearby. Each agency uses algorithms to filter the effects of these changes out of the temperature record and interpolate where data is sparse, like over the vast southern ocean, when calculating global averages. Generally, all three datasets agree quite closely (see graph above) and are in agreement on the trend of global warming since the Industrial Revolution. \n\nREAD MORE\n\n*   [Temperature data from NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/)\n*   [Temperature data from the UK Climatic Research Unit](http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/)[ (University of East Anglia) / Meteorological Office's Hadley Centre](http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/)\n*   [Temperature data from NOAA's National Climatic Data Center](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/monitoring-references/faq/anomalies.php)	https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/
What do volcanoes have to do with climate change?	Mount Pinatubo during its 1991 eruption Overall, volcanoes release about 5 percent of the equivalent amount of CO2 released by humans. Quite small. However, about once every 20 years there is a volcanic eruption (e.g., Mount Pinatubo, El Chichon) that throws out a tremendous amount of particles and other gases. These will effectively shield us enough from the sun to lead to a period of [global cooling](http://climate.nasa.gov/blog/183). The particles and gases typically dissipate after about 2 years, but the effect is nearly global.	https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/

What kinds of data do scientists use to study climate?	Climate researchers use every possible direct and indirect measurement to study the full history of Earth's climate, from the latest satellite observations to samples of prehistoric ice extracted from glaciers. When they focus on changes of the past 100-150 years, they use observations made by modern scientific instruments. Although the mercury thermometer and barometer were both invented in the 1700s, they and other modern instruments were not widely used for weather observations till much later. In the United States, most weather stations were established in the late 1800s.	https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/
Where do the data come from?	\n\nModern observations mostly come from weather stations, weather balloons, radars, ships and buoys, and satellites. A surprisingly large number of U.S. measurements are still made by volunteer weather watchers. There are more than 8,700 citizen observers in the National Weather Service's [Cooperative Observer Program](http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/coop/) who log daily weather data. On the oceans, moored and drifting buoys have begun to replace ships in recent decades as the primary method for measuring temperatures at sea.\n\nThe U.S. organization responsible for preserving the global climate record is the [National Climatic Data Center](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/) (NCDC) of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Other nations also maintain archives of global weather and climate observations.\n	https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/
Can scientists use the data as is?	\n\nNo. To understand why not, imagine you're a nurse checking a patient's chart. You find the following temperature readings (Fahrenheit) for the last few hours: 99.2, 99.8, 1000, 101.4. You'd know immediately that the third number was a mistake. To make a realistic assessment of the patient's condition, you'd have to either adjust it or throw it out.\n\nWeather observers are as human as nurses, and they also make occasional mistakes in recording and transcribing their observations: impossibly high highs and low lows, the exact same temperatures for two months in a row, etc. The first step in data processing is quality control: identifying and eliminating erroneous data.\n	https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/
Once the mistakes are eliminated, are the data ready to use?	\n\nNot yet. They have to be adjusted to account for all the changes that happen over time:\n\n• The landscape has changed dramatically in the last 100-150 years. Villages have become cities; roads have been paved; trees have been planted and cut down.\n\n• The observers have changed. Weather watchers have retired and been replaced by people living uphill, downhill or across town.\n\n• Daily times of observation have changed.\n\n• The technology has changed. Mercury-in-glass thermometers have been replaced by more modern systems. Broken instruments have been replaced by new ones whose readings may not be perfectly consistent.\n\nNone of these changes has anything to do with climate, but they all leave a mark on temperature data. Some changes are known to raise temperatures, like urbanization; others are known to lower them, like the change from liquid-in-glass thermometers to maximum/minimum temperature systems. If these biases are not compensated for, we cannot understand how the climate itself is changing. \n	https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/
How do scientists deal with these changes?	\n\nMajor climate research organizations worldwide have developed mathematically rigorous, peer-reviewed data processing methods to identify and compensate for changes in observing conditions. Since the research groups are independent, they do not use exactly the same techniques. One example is the way two U.S. research institutions deal with a well-known problem, the [urban heat island] effect - the fact that cities are warmer than the surrounding countryside. NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) addresses this problem using satellite images of nighttime lights to classify stations as urban, near-urban or rural, then compares the urbanized records with an average of nearby rural stations to calculate the extent by which urbanization has warmed the data. NCDC, in processing station data for its U.S. climate divisional dataset (nClimDiv) and Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN), corrects for the urban heat island effect and other changes such as station moves by using a technique that compares each station with multiple neighboring stations to find "guilty" stations and calculate the magnitude of necessary corrections.\n\nOverviews of the data-processing techniques for NCDC's nClimDiv and GHCN are available on GISS's data analysis methods, with links to papers giving full scientific explanations, are described	https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/
How do scientists know their data-processing techniques are reliable?	\n\nThe records of global temperatures calculated by U.S. and other major climate research organizations are remarkably similar, despite the different data-processing techniques used. The techniques used by GISS, NCDC and other respected groups such as the British Meteorological Office's [Hadley Centre](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate-guide/science/science-behind-climate-change/hadley)/[Climatic Research Unit](http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/) of the University of East Anglia (CRU) and the Australian [Bureau of Meteorology](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/) are peer reviewed, as mentioned above, and the processed data sets have undergone many peer-reviewed analyses as well.\n\nAn independent nonprofit organization called [Berkeley Earth](http://www.berkeleyearth.org/), funded by educational grants, has devised its own data processing techniques to deal with the changes listed above. Again, the results are very similar to results from NCDC, GISS and the CRU.\n	https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/
Does data processing make temperature data warmer?	It can go either way. Almost half of NOAA's corrected data are cooler than the original records. NOAA's corrections of temperatures over the oceans - done to compensate for changes in methods of observing the temperature of water at the surface of the ocean - reduced the warming trend in global temperature.	https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/
Does data processing destroy the original data?	An example of the original weather and climate records archived at NCDC. Station records like this one are available [here](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/IPS/coop/coop.html). No, the original records are preserved and are available at no cost online. You can access NCDC's U.S. and global records [here](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access).\n\nFor more technical answers on this topic, visit [GISS's FAQs](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/FAQ.html) and [NCDC's FAQs](http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/v3/GHCNM-v3.2.0-FAQ.pdf).\n	https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/
If all of Earth's ice melts and flows into the ocean, what would happen to the planet's rotation?	Credit: BlueRingMedia/Shutterstock.com. \n\nThe Earth rotates about its axis once a day, but it does not do so uniformly. Instead, the rate of rotation varies by up to a millisecond per day. Like a spinning ice skater whose speed of rotation increases as the skater's arms are brought closer to their body, the speed of the Earth's rotation will increase if its mass is brought closer to its axis of rotation. Conversely, the speed of the Earth's rotation will decrease if its mass is moved away from the rotation axis.\n\nMelting land ice, like mountain glaciers and the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, will change the Earth's rotation only if the meltwater flows into the oceans. If the meltwater remains close to its source (by being trapped in a glacier lake, for example), then there is no net movement of mass away from the glacier or ice sheet, and the Earth's rotation won't change. But if the meltwater flows into the oceans and is dispersed, then there is a net movement of mass and the Earth's rotation will change. For example, if the Greenland ice sheet were to completely melt and the meltwater were to completely flow into the oceans, then global sea level would rise by about seven meters (23 feet) and the Earth would rotate more slowly, with the length of the day becoming longer than it is today, by about two milliseconds.\n\nMelting sea ice, such as the Arctic ice cap, does not change sea level because the ice displaces its volume and, hence, does not change the Earth's rotation.\n	https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/

Which is a bigger methane source: cow belching or cow flatulence?	Contrary to common belief, it's cow belching due to enteric fermentation. ("Enteric fermentation" is the digestive process of converting sugars into simple molecules for absorption into the bloodstream, which produces methane as a by-product.) However, a small percentage of methane is also produced in the cow's large intestine and then expelled. Settling ponds and lagoons for processing manure also produce copious amounts of this greenhouse gas.	https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/

What is the proof that life exists on Mars?	One of the main bits of evidence that life has existed on Mars came from a meteorite that was found in the Antarctic. The meteorite came from Mars many years ago when a rock smashed into the surface and sent the rock flying off into space. Eventually it landed here on Earth. \n\n  \nInside the rock we found tiny little things that are the result of some sort of very simple life. We do not know if life still exists on Mars but if it does it will be very simple life deep under the surface.	http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/kids/astronomy/mars_questions.shtml
I have done a volcano/Olympus Moons project and I was wondering what the correct answer was for how many days there are in Mars in a year.	A Martian year is equal to 687 Earth Days. \nThat makes the year on Mars about twice as long as a year on Earth.	http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/kids/astronomy/mars_questions.shtml
I know a year on Mars lasts 687 Earth days but why does it last that long when its days are only 24 hours and 37 minutes?	The length of a day is fixed by the time it takes a planet to spin once on \nits axis. The length of the year is the time it takes for the planet to go around \nthe Sun. There is no real relationship between the two.	http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/kids/astronomy/mars_questions.shtml
Why has Olympus Mons been able to 'grow' so much bigger then any volcano on earth?	One of the main reasons volcanoes on Mars are bigger than ours here on Earth \nis that the gravity on Mars is less. Gravity is the force \nthat holds us and everything else on the surface of the Earth. \n\n  \nIf \nthe gravity were stronger on Earth then we would all be pulled harder against \nthe surface. The pull of gravity on Mars is weaker than it is on Earth so things \nare not pulled toward the surface so strongly. It's because of this that Olympus \nMons could grow so big.	http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/kids/astronomy/mars_questions.shtml
How long does it take for a day in Mars?	A day on Mars \nis 24 hours and 37 minutes, a little longer than a day on Earth.	http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/kids/astronomy/mars_questions.shtml
Does Mars have ice on the inside or outside?	When we \nlook at Mars through a telescope we can see white spots on the top and bottom. \nThey are actually areas where ice has formed around Mars' North and South pole.   \n\nWhen we \nlook at Mars through a telescope we can see white spots on the top and bottom. \nThey are actually areas where ice has formed around Mars' North and South pole	http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/kids/astronomy/mars_questions.shtml

How long does a year last on Mars?	One year on Mars is equal to 687 Earth days, making the Martian year nearly \ntwice as long as ours.	http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/kids/astronomy/mars_questions.shtml
Why do we never see Mars?	We do get to see Mars quite often. We will be able \nto see it again clearly in the evening sky later this year during the end of Summer \n2005.	http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/kids/astronomy/mars_questions.shtml
I know that Mars has an atmosphere, but, if air is put in it, will it stay in the planet, or is that a film fantasy?	Mars is only about half the size of the Earth and its \ngravity isn't as strong. If we did manage to make the atmosphere suitable for \nus to live there, we would have to ensure that it was kept topped up.   \n\n\n\nThe \ngravity of Mars is not strong enough to hold on to an atmosphere that we would \nneed to survive. It would be possible however to make special buildings that would \nstop the atmosphere from escaping which we could live in along with plants and \nanimals.	http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/kids/astronomy/mars_questions.shtml

A meteor was found on Earth that came from Mars. How do you know where it came from?	In the 1970s the Viking spacecraft landed on Mars. When it was there, it measured the types and mixture of gas in the atmosphere. \n\nThe meteorite that was found had tiny pockets of gas trapped inside it.\n\n On checking the types and mixture of gasses in the pockets of gas, we found that it was exactly the same as the Viking spacecraft had measured on Mars. \n\nWe have not found this mixture anywhere else.	http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/kids/astronomy/mars_questions.shtml
How many days are in a year on Mars?	One year on Mars is equal to 780 Earth days. \n	http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/kids/astronomy/mars_questions.shtml
How long does it take Mars to go round the sun?	Mars takes 687 days to go around the Sun. That's a \nlittle less than 2 years.	http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/kids/astronomy/mars_questions.shtml
Wouldn't a thicker Martian atmosphere escape into space because of mars' weaker gravity?	Because Mars has about one-third of the gravity that the Earth has then yes, a thicker Martian atmosphere would escape into space.   \n\n\n\nIt would take many millions of years for this to happen but it is why Mars does not have a thick atmosphere today.\n\n If we were to try to set-up a permanent home on Mars we would have to use some kind of building that would contain the atmosphere and stop it escaping into space.	http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/kids/astronomy/mars_questions.shtml
What is Mars' distance from the sun, how many days does it take to complete one orbit and how many earth days does it take to rotate once on its axis?	Like \nall of the planets in the solar system, they all have an elliptical orbit around \nthe Sun. \n\nThe shape of an elliptical orbit is similar \nto the shape of a squashed circle. Because of the elliptical orbit, the distance \nfrom Mars to the Sun varies over its year. \n\nWe can \nwork out that on average, Mars is 228 million km away from the Sun and it takes \na little under 687 Earth days to complete one orbit. \n\nSpinning \nonce on its axis takes Mars 24 hours, 37 minutes and 23 seconds.	http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/kids/astronomy/mars_questions.shtml

What is the temperature on Jupiter?	When it comes to temperature, Jupiter maintains this reputation for extremity, ranging from extreme cold to extreme hot. But since the planet has no surface to speak of, being a gas giant, it's temperature cannot be accurately measured in one place - and varies greatly between its upper atmosphere and core. However, scientists have obtained readings on what the temperature is at the upper edge of the cloud cover: approximately -145 degrees C.	Editorial
What is the length of a year on Jupiter?	Given its considerable distance from the Sun, Jupiter spends the equivalent of almost twelve Earth years completing a single circuit of our Sun. Orbiting at this distance is part of what allows Jupiter to maintain its gaseous nature, and led to its formation and peculiar composition.	Editorial
What is the length of a day on Jupiter?	A day on Jupiter, lasts almost 10 hours. Jupiter is the fastest rotating body in our Solar System. Determining the length of a day on Jupiter was very difficult, because, unlike the terrestrial planets, it does not have surface features that scientists could use to determine its rotational speed.	Editorial
How long are the seasons on Jupiter?	Jupiter does not experience seasonal changes the way the other planets do - particularly if you compare it to Earth. As a result, temperatures do not vary considerably between the northern or southern hemispheres during the course of its orbit. <br/> Measurements taken from the top of Jupiter's clouds (which is considered to be the surface) indicate that surface temperatures vary between 165 K and 112 K (-108 °C and -161 °C). However, temperatures vary considerably due to depth, increasing drastically as one ventures closer to the core.	Editorial
How many moons does Jupiter have?	Lately, this question has had a changing answer. For many years, we knew of 16 moons for the largest planet in our solar system.  The last few years, about two dozen new moons have been announced by astronomers.

How dense is the atmosphere of the Sun?	The Sun's atmosphere, is made up of three distinct layers - the chromosphere, the transitional region, and the corona. The chromosphere (literally "sphere of color") is roughly 2,000 kilometers deep and has a very low density (10-4 times that of the photosphere and 10-8 times that of Earth's atmosphere). Above the chromosphere is the thin transition region (200 km thick), where temperatures rise rapidly from 20,000 K in the upper layer to close to 1,000,000 K at the corona.  Lastly, there is the corona. In the lower region, the particle density is extremely low and the average temperature is about 1 - 2 million K - with the hottest regions ranging between 8 and 20 million K.	Editorial

What is the temperature of the Sun?	Estimates of the Sun's temperature vary the closer one gets to its core. Within the center, temperature are estimates to be as high as 15 and a half million °C, while the Corona experiences temperatures of about 5 million °C, and the visible surface reaches an effective temperature of 5504 °C.	Editorial
What is the structure of the Sun?	The Sun is composed primarily of the chemical elements hydrogen and helium, which account for 74.9% and 23.8% of the mass of the Sun in the photosphere, respectively. All heavier elements account for less than 2% of the Sun's mass, with oxygen (roughly 1% of the Sun's mass), carbon (0.3%), neon (0.2%), and iron (0.2%) being the most abundant.  \n\n\nThe interior of the Sun is differentiated between multiple layers, which includes a core, a radiative zone, a convective zone, a photosphere, and an atmosphere. The core is the most dense and hottest region of the Sun (150 g/cm³/15.7 million K) and accounts for about 20-25% of the Sun's overall radius.	Editorial
